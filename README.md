## About

As a third-year Software Engineering student at McMaster University, I am driven by an insatiable curiosity, a passion for knowledge, and a strong determination to make an impact in the tech world. My journey in Software Engineering isn't just about coding; it's about creating innovations that drive positive change in both the industry and society.

I'm on a mission to contribute to cutting-edge projects that push the boundaries of technology and enhance the way we live. My academic journey has equipped me with a solid foundation in software development and problem-solving, and I'm eager to apply these skills in real-world scenarios.

Currently seeking co-op positions, I am excited to bring my expertise, enthusiasm, and fresh perspective to a dynamic team. I'm eager to learn, grow, and explore new challenges, all while nurturing a deep-seated passion for the field.

Let's connect and explore how we can collaborate to create a more innovative and sustainable future together.
